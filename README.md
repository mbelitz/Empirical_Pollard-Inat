# Repository hosting data and code to run analyses and generate figures for manuscript titled "Consistent buttterfly flight phenology drivers emerge from both incidental and survey data". 

## Sub-directories
### Rcode
Holds code to generate phenology analyses (pheno_analysis.R) and figures (final_figures.R). Also hosts code to make gdd data (gdd.R) and incidental phenology estimates (fiftieth_estimates.R & tenth_estimates.R) into usable data formats for analysis.

### Data
Hosts data for analyses and figures. Includes raw incidental adult butterfly data records aggregated from iNaturalist and eButterfly (total_incidental_bfly_data.csv). Files of butterfly phenometrics are fiftieth_iNat_estimates.csv, tenth_inat_estimates.csv, and pollard_indices.RData for the incidental and survey data, respectively. *Species trait data* can be found in the excel file "LarsenEtAl_Appendix1b.xlsx

### inat_image_annotation
Holds csvs of annotated iNaturalist images that were scored by life stage to ensure we only included adult butterflies in our analyses. 

### Supplement
Hosts csv file that has information about where we sourced our "day 0" values.
